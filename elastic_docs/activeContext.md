# Active Context: React Games Collection

## Current Focus
The current focus is on the Water Balloon Game component, which is a grid-based game where players control a character at the bottom of the screen and shoot water balloons upward to hit targets. The game includes:

1. A 20x20 grid game board
2. Player movement using left and right arrow keys
3. Balloon shooting using the space bar
4. Randomly generated targets at the top of the grid
5. Score tracking and game completion logic
6. Local storage for saving game records
7. A "Memory Bank" feature that displays game statistics and history

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the Water Balloon Game component with core gameplay mechanics
- Added collision detection between balloons and targets
- Implemented game completion logic when all targets are hit
- Created a memory bank feature to display game statistics and history
- Added local storage persistence for game records

## Next Steps
1. **Code Optimization**: Review the Water Balloon Game component for potential performance improvements
2. **UI Enhancements**: Consider adding animations for balloon movement and target hits
3. **Game Difficulty**: Implement difficulty levels with varying target counts and movement patterns
4. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for game actions
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game works well on different screen sizes
6. **Additional Games**: Consider adding more games to the collection
7. **Unified Styling**: Create a consistent visual theme across all games

## Active Decisions
1. Using React hooks for state management instead of class components
2. Storing game records in localStorage for persistence
3. Implementing game logic with TypeScript interfaces for type safety
4. Using CSS for styling with inline styles for dynamic properties
5. Separating game components to maintain code organization
6. Using useEffect hooks for game loop and event handling
