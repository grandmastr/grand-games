# System Patterns: React Games Collection

## System Architecture
The React Games Collection follows a component-based architecture typical of React applications. The system is organized as follows:

1. **Root Application**: The main App component serves as the container for all game components
2. **Game Components**: Individual, self-contained game implementations (TicTacToe, SnakeGame, WaterBalloonGame)
3. **Shared Utilities**: Common functions and helpers that may be used across multiple games
4. **CSS Styling**: Component-specific CSS files for styling

## Key Technical Decisions

### Component Structure
- Each game is implemented as a standalone functional component
- Games maintain their own internal state using React hooks
- Components are responsible for their own rendering, game logic, and user interaction

### State Management
- Using React's useState hook for component-level state
- Complex state transitions handled with useEffect hooks
- No global state management (Redux, Context API) as each game is self-contained
- Local storage used for persisting game records and high scores

### Rendering Approach
- Grid-based games (like Water Balloon Game) use div elements arranged in a grid
- Game elements are positioned using CSS with dynamic styling
- Game loops implemented using setInterval within useEffect hooks

### Event Handling
- Keyboard events captured at the window level using event listeners
- Mouse/touch interactions handled with standard React event handlers
- Event listeners properly cleaned up in useEffect return functions

## Design Patterns

### Component Composition
- Games are composed of smaller, focused UI elements
- Main game components handle the orchestration of these elements

### Observer Pattern
- Event listeners observe user input and trigger state updates
- useEffect hooks observe state changes and trigger side effects

### Factory Pattern
- Functions that generate game elements (e.g., targets, balloons)

### Command Pattern
- User inputs translated to game commands (move, shoot, etc.)

### Memento Pattern
- Game state saved to localStorage for persistence

## Component Relationships

### App Component
- Root component that renders the active game component
- Handles navigation between different games

### Game Components
- Self-contained with their own state, rendering, and logic
- No direct dependencies between game components
- May share common styling patterns but maintain independent implementations

### Data Flow
- Unidirectional data flow from state to rendered UI
- User interactions trigger state updates, which cause re-renders
- No prop drilling or complex state sharing between components
