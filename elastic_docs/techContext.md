# Technical Context: React Games Collection

## Technologies Used

### Core Framework
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing
- **Create React App**: Toolchain for setting up React applications

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback
- **Local Storage API**: For persisting game data between sessions

### Styling
- **CSS**: Component-specific stylesheets
- **Inline Styles**: For dynamic styling based on game state

### Build & Development
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **npm**: Package manager for JavaScript
- **Webpack**: Module bundler (included in Create React App)
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler (included in Create React App)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+) or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd react-games-collection

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No IE11 support required

### Performance Considerations
- Game loops should be optimized to prevent excessive re-renders
- Event listeners should be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Large game boards should implement virtualization if needed

### Code Organization
- Components should be self-contained
- CSS should be modular and component-specific
- TypeScript interfaces should be used for type safety

## Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- react
- react-dom
- react-scripts
- typescript
- web-vitals

### Development Dependencies
- @testing-library/react
- @testing-library/jest-dom
- @testing-library/user-event
- @types/react
- @types/react-dom
- @types/jest
- @types/node

## Deployment
The application is designed to be deployed as a static website. It can be hosted on any static hosting service such as:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- AWS S3
- Firebase Hosting

No backend services are required as all game data is stored in the browser's localStorage.
