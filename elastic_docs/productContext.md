2. **Entertainment**: Offers engaging browser-based games that can be played without installation
3. **Code Reference**: Demonstrates patterns for handling user input, game state, and local storage persistence
4. **Component Isolation**: Shows how to create self-contained game components that can be easily integrated into larger applications

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Controls**: Games should be easy to understand and play with minimal instructions
2. **Responsive Feedback**: Players should receive immediate visual feedback for their actions
3. **Progress Tracking**: Games should save progress and high scores to enhance replayability
4. **Consistent Interface**: While each game is unique, the overall collection should maintain a consistent look and feel
5. **Accessibility**: Games should be playable across different devices and screen sizes

## Target Audience
1. **Casual Gamers**: Users looking for simple browser-based games
2. **React Developers**: Programmers looking for examples of React game implementation
3. **Learning Developers**: Those studying React, TypeScript, and state management patterns
4. **Portfolio Viewers**: Potential employers or clients evaluating the developer's skills

## Success Metrics
1. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-typed code
2. **Game Completeness**: Fully functional games with proper mechanics
3. **User Engagement**: Games that are fun to play and encourage repeated sessions
