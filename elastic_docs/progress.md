## Known Issues

### Water Balloon Game
1. No visual feedback when balloons hit targets beyond the target disappearing
2. Player can shoot multiple balloons in quick succession, which may affect game balance
3. No mobile/touch support for controls
4. Memory Bank styling could be improved for better readability
5. No animations for game elements, making the visual experience somewhat static

### General Issues
1. No centralized navigation between games
2. Inconsistent styling between different game components
3. Limited responsive design for smaller screens
4. No sound effects or accessibility features
5. Limited documentation for component usage and game rules
