# Project Brief: React Games Collection

## Overview
This project is a collection of browser-based games built with React and TypeScript. The collection currently includes several games such as TicTacToe, Snake Game, and Water Balloon Game. Each game is implemented as a separate React component with its own state management and UI.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide engaging, interactive game experiences
2. Implement proper game mechanics and physics
3. Store game progress and high scores locally
4. Maintain responsive and intuitive user interfaces
5. Follow React best practices and TypeScript type safety

## Current Games
- **TicTacToe**: Classic two-player game
- **Snake Game**: Implementation of the classic snake game
- **Water Balloon Game**: A grid-based game where players shoot water balloons at targets

## Technical Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS for styling
- Local storage for game data persistence

## Goals
- Create a cohesive collection of well-implemented games
- Demonstrate React component architecture and state management
- Provide clean, maintainable code with proper TypeScript typing
- Implement engaging game mechanics with proper user feedback
